        <p>2020 has been... a year</p>
        <p>I can honestly say, since the last time I posted on this blog, I've gained so many levels as a programmer. While remaking the repo on my computer, there were so many little things that I do or don't do anymore.</p>
        <p>For example, in my JavaScript, I prefer the aesthetic of as few lines and characters as possible. My past self, however, didnae give af ðŸ˜…. now I'm a lot more conscious about not repeating code and keeping things modular</p>
        <p>
          That said, my reckless, uninhibited style was somewhat freeing. By not worrying about the details I could get things done a lot quicker (until I couldn't).
          Now, I'm always wondering "is this the most modular way to write the code?" or "Am I repeating myself / reinventing wheels??".
        </p>

        <p>Makes you miss the simpler days of 'no refactor! only code!'.</p>

        <p>But anyways, 2020 right?</p>

        <p>
          It's not all bad. I started a whole company!!! It's called Lilac Snacc LLC. Ya girl a real businessman now purr ðŸ’…
          As you can see I've also become hella gay ðŸ˜‚ tricked some dude into being my bf somehow so that's nice ðŸ˜‚
        </p>
        <p>
          Experienced all sorts of things, from wine-tastings to yacht parties to collecting unemployment to freelancing. Currently doing a freelancing gig for a friend while I search for more stable work (and work on the business).
        </p>
        <p>
          That's part of what reviving this blog is for! While applying, one of my reviewers tipped me off to polish my LinkedIn and start blogging again. And honestly, I agree.<br>
          It feels really good to write in my little eDiary again. Also it's kinda funny how much I've changed like in terms of personality. I was so much more serious / strict...
        </p>
        <p>
          ... Actually, you know what happened? I turned 21 and forgot how to act ðŸ˜‚ Once I started clubbing and partying a lot more, I got to explore the type of person I am and want to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tired concept of the reclusive, awkward nerd was never for me anyways. PLUS, when you start realizing how silly things are, it's hard to stay serious.
        <p>
          For example, the US gov.
        </p>
        <p>
          Girl ðŸ˜« do you know we are in a World War Z type pandemic and it took our gov't 9 months to decide to give the people... *drumroll*... $600? ðŸ˜­
          Before that, there was one single payment of $1200 in March. Y'all it is DECEMBER
        </p>
        <p>
          My bad I skipped over the part where literally 3,000+ Americans are dying from the virus PER DAY. And gov't goes "here, a pence for your troubles"
        </p>
        <p>
          No like the gov't literally sent everyone $5 / day and said 'make it work' ðŸ˜­.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh girl I skipped over the part where there's also a civil war, a war on lower class people, neo-nazis (girl u heard me right T_T), insider trading on vaccines, some kinda eugenecist "herd immunity" movement, and our superstar president is literally trying to undermine state governments and the electoral process, and... girl I'm tired.
        </p>
        <p>
          But anyways... believe it or not I'm looking forward to the future! Every day I get closer to my goals (living in the city, running a business, etc). So yes, shit's wild. But for now, I'm making due.
